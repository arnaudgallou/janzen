# Main figures

Figure 1. Spatial distribution of the 37 mountain locations used in the study. The size of the dots is proportional to the number of species in each location. In red, elevational gradients between 2000 m and 2500 m; in blue, elevational gradients ≥ 2500 m.

Figure 2. Relationships between the mean species’ elevational range size and diurnal temperature range (A), temperature seasonality (B) and the variation of mean annual temperature in the last 21,000 years before present (C). Points represent the estimated mean elevational range sizes with their respective standard error in each of the 33 standardized transects ≥ 2500 m. Thick lines are the posterior mean calculated from 400 random draws sampled from the 95% credible interval (thin blue lines).

Figure 3. Results from the analyses investigating the responses of species’ elevational range sizes to diurnal temperature range (A) and temperature seasonality (B) within each 38 sites used in the study. Histograms are of mean slope terms divided by their standard deviation from the 95% credible interval for the mountain-specific analyses. Colors indicate whether the 95% credible interval includes 0 or not. Dashed lines indicate 0.
